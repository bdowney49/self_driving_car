# AI Self Driving Car

Welcome to the repo for my AI Self Driving Car Class

In this repo you will find the scripts for my final race code including launching, localizing, path planning, and PID steering.

## Projects
Here you can find a few of my projects completed in the course, including a localization in a room using a particle filter and LiDAR sensor hardware, a PID program to perform real time steering, and a path planning script based on A* planning.
