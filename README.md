# AI Self Driving Car

Welcome to the repo for my AI Self Driving Car Class

In this repo you will find the scripts for my final race code including launching, localizing, path planning, and PID steering.

## Projects
Here you can find a few of my projects completed in the course, including a localization in a room using a particle filter and LiDAR sensor hardware, a PID program to perform real time steering, and a path planning script based on A* planning. 

Each one of these projects can be found in the labs folder, and they were all written on ROS (Robot Operating System), and simulated using a virtual robot car and simulated environment, then launched on the real car and drove itself around the ECE Basement in the final race!
